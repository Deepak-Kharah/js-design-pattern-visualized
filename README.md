# Design pattern visualized

This repository contains a collection of design patterns visualized in a simple and easy to understand way.

**Design Patterns** are general, repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for solving a problem that can be used in many different situations.

As software engineers, we often learn and use these design patterns to scale our applications. Many sites teach you how to use these patterns, but there are also places where you can see them in action. This project is the answer to that. It doesn't teach you how to build the pattern; instead, it helps you visualize how it works by allowing you to play around with them.

I built this site to strengthen my knowledge about design patterns and sharpen my front-end development skills by designing and developing the website from scratch. Simultaneously, I helped devs worldwide understand these patterns by visualizing them.

## Contributing to the project

If you want to contribute to the project, you can do so by adding new design patterns or improving the existing ones. You can also help by fixing bugs or improving the website's design and performance.

We don't have a strict guideline for contributing for now, but we will soon add one.
